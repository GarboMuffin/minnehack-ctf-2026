        <h1><%= it.EVENT_NAME %> 2026 is coming soon</h1>
        <p><b>When:</b> 5:00 PM Saturday February 14 - Noon February 15</p>
        <p><b>Prize:</b> There will be a prize :)</p>
        <p><b>Teams:</b> <i>For just the CTF specifically, prize will only be available to people competing individually</i>. If you're just showing up to have fun and don't want the prize we can't stop you from getting together and having a good time, but none of you can get the prize. The rest of MinneHack is still up to 4 people per team.</p>
        <p><b>Difficulty:</b> We're trying to support a variety of skill levels. If you're a beginner, we can help you learn. If you're an experienced CTF player you'll find the event to be on the easier end, but think we have a few interesting or at least unique challenges in here.</p>
        <p><b>Categories:</b></p>
        <ul>
            <li>The classics: Reverse engineering, binary exploitation, web security, a tiny bit of cryptography</li>
            <li>Some unusual ones: Minecraft, Scratch, hijacking npm packages</li>
            <li>A zero-day in a large open source project (we told them about it two years ago so it's not actually a zero day, but it's just still not fixed)</li>
            <li>Maybe more surpises. We're still writing stuff.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><b>Writeups:</b> Planning to publish things in March so you can learn about what you missed. We're not writing these ahead of time so it'll take a while :(</p>
